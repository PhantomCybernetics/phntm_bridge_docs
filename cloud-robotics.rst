Cloud robotics
==============

Phantom Bridge can not only be used for human teleoperation and monitoring,
AI and expert systems can also be used to control an autonomous machine from the cloud.
Thanks to very fast networking and various bandwidth optimizations,
you can offload compute-intense vision and decision making tasks from the edge device
and significantly lower CPU/GPU demands and power requirements of the robot itself.
All this has a major impact on the cost of the necessary hardware.
