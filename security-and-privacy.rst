Security & Privacy
==================

All communication between the ROS machine and the peers (web UI) takes place over encrypted channels.

The Bridge Server only stores basic metadata about the Robot for purpose of improving the service.

No telemetry data or video is ever stored on any part of the Phantom infrastructure.

The maintainer's email is only used for service announcements.

We don't sell personal data to any 3rd parties.
