Phantom Bridge Documentation
============================

Phantom Bridge is a fast WebRTC ROS2 Bridge written in C++
for real-time ROS2 data visualization and video streaming, teleoperation, human-robot interaction,
and both local and remote robot monitoring.

The Bridge comes with Docker Container control for the host machine, system load and Wi-Fi monitoring,
and customizable Web Interface for both desktop and mobile touchscreen devices.

This suite is indended to be a modern replacement for RViz, in many cases going beyong what is
typically consideted a ROS visualization tool, in order to make robotics development with ROS2 easier.
The UI is customizable with JavaScrip & CSS plugins, various configuration options make it suitable
both as a universal development tool and a customer-facing product.

Features
========
- Connects P2P or via a TURN server when P2P link is not possible
- ~5-10ms RTT on local network, 20ms+ RTT remote teleoperation via a TURN server (provided)
- ROS2 topic and service discovery
- Fast streamimg of binary ROS2 messages (both in a out)
- Fast H.264 video streaming, ROS2 Image and CompressedImage topics streamed as H.264 video (hw or sw-encodeded frames)
- Docker container discovery and control
- Reliable ROS2 Service calls via Socket.io
- ROS2 Parameneters discovery, read and write at runtime
- Keyboard, Gamepad and Touch interface user input mapped into ROS2 messages
- Extra ROS2 Packages can be easily included for custom message type support
- Robot's Wi-Fi signal monitoring, network scanning & roaming (requires wpa_supplicant)
- File retreival from any running Docker container and host fs (such as URDF models)
- System load, Disk space, and Docker stats monitoring
- Standalone lightweight Bridge Agent for monitoring and management of various parts of a distributed system
- Multiple peers can connect to the same machine at a very low extra CPU cost
- Works with rosbag and simulators such as Gazebo, Isaac Sim or Webots
- Fully open-source under the MIT license; you can host any part of this system
- User interface customizable with JavaScript & CSS plug-ins
- No need for an X server running on your robot, nor for any wired connections
