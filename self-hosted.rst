Self-hosted Cloud Infrastructure
================================

All the necessary cloud infrastrucure is hosted by `Phantom Cybernetics <https://www.phantomcybernetics.com>`_ and provided free
of charge for your conveninence. However, you can also decide to host the Bridge Server and/or Web UI servers yourself.

.. Note:: You don't need to host any part of the Phantom Bridge cloud infrastrucure to :doc:`extensively modify or customize the UI </ui/customize>`.

Should your main motivation for self-hosting be geographical distance and related response times, see :doc:`Availability zones </availability-zones>`
and consider hosting only a `TURN server <https://github.com/PhantomCybernetics/phntm_bridge_server?tab=readme-ov-file#turnstun-server>`_ for
simplicity and cost efficiency.
