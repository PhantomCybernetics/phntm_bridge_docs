Self-hosted Cloud Bridge
========================

All the necessary cloud infrastrucure is hosted by Phantom Cybernetics and provided free of charge for your conveninence.
However, you can also host the Bridge Cloud and Web UI servers yourself.

Should your main motivation be geographical distance and related response times, see :doc:`Availability zones </availability-zones>`
and consider hosting only a `TURN server <https://github.com/PhantomCybernetics/cloud_bridge?tab=readme-ov-file#turnstun-server>`_ for simplicity and cost efficiency.

Follow these links for more info:

- `Cloud Bridge on GitHub <https://github.com/PhantomCybernetics/cloud_bridge>`_
- `Bridge UI on GitHub <https://github.com/PhantomCybernetics/bridge_ui>`_

.. Note:: Note that you don't need to host the full Bridge UI server in order to develop and deploy custom UI widgets or input drivers.
