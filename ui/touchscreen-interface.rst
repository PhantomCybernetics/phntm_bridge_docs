Touchscreen Interface
=====================

The Web UI is optimized for touchscreen devices, automatically detects phones and tablets and 
adjusts for better ergonomy. The main menu with Nodes, Topics, Services etc becomes a hamburger menu ``≡`` in the top left, and so on.

A virtual gamepad with two axes is provided and can be mapped to custom control messages same way you would map any physical controller.
You can also add :ref:`custom buttons <custom-touchscreen-buttons>` that only appear when touchscreen is used.

Touchscreen-specific Gestures
-----------------------------

* To resize or move a panel, ``tap and hold its title bar (the label) for 2 seconds``, until the panel turns green
* To maximize any panel into fullscreen, ``double tap on its content``, then double tap on it again to exit fullscreen mode

Fullscreen Mode
---------------

* On Android, to switch the whole Web UI to fullscreen (hiding the address bar, etc.), click the ``[ ]`` icon in the ``≡`` (hamburger) menu.
* On iOS, only Safari is able to switch to fullscreen at the time of writing, use the ``Hide Toolbar`` option. Neither Mobile Opera nor Chrome offers fullscreen capability on iOS.
